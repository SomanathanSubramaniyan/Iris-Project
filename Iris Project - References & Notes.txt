KeyPoints:
The data set consists of 50 samples from each of three species of Iris (Iris setosa, Iris virginica and Iris versicolor). 
Four features were measured from each sample: the length and the width of the sepals and petals, in centimetres. 
Based on the combination of these four features, Fisher developed a linear discriminant model to distinguish the species from each other.

How and Where it is used:
New types of Sorting models uses Iris data set as an input
Iris data set is used by IBM watson analytics engine
